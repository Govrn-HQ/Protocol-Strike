# Protocol Working Team

## Context:

For the next 4 months, we want to focus on building out our Protocol that creates a new contribution primitive aimed at recording off chain DAO contributions/engagements on chain.  This is not only a key building block for Govrn, but provides a key piece of missing DAO infrastructure - the ability for DAO contributors to own their physical value or sweat equity contributions.

## Key Drivers/Team:

- Drivers (2): Keating, Scott
- Contributors:

## Summary:

There are 4 main process steps of the protocol:

1. Reporting: An oracle process that creates the input for off chain contributions to be reported to the protocol.
2. Mint: The process to structure the contribution and store it on chain (or as a property of an on chain object)
3. Verification/Approval: A composable add on for contributions to assign a level of verification at the contribution level.
4. Value Loop: The ability for a contributor or DAO to derive value from the protocol by reading and using the primitive data

We think this workstream will focus on the first two steps, Reporting and Minting.  While the other two steps need to be considered in the design choices, they should be composable and will mainly be driven by another work team.

**Note:** While there is a major UI component of how someone will interact with the protocol, this group will focus specifically on the protocol and not the UI/UX a user goes through on the protocol interactions.
