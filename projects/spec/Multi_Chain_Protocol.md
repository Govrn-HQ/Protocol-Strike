# Multi-Chain Protocol

Chain differences are minimal so deploying the main contract to multiple chains is straightforward to get rolling assuming the universes don't want to co-mingle. But it'd be ideal if DAOs and contributors didn't need to worry about being on synchronous chains.

## Chain Deploys for v1

- Gnosis Chain

## Cross Chain Attestation

In order to satisfy the needs of contributors in a multi-chain world we'd (likely) want to be able to attest to contributions on other chains.

## Counting Contributions on other chains

In order to satisfy the needs of organizations in a multi-chain world we'd want to be able to aggregate contributions attributed across chains toward activity and value created.

## Early Multi-Chain Chains

- Polygon
- Arbitrum
- Optimism
