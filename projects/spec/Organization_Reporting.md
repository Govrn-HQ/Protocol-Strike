# Reporting

Reports will help DAO coordinators to be able to understand and share information with the DAO at large about their contributors and value-added.

## User Journeys

Needs:

1. As a Coordinator, I need to be able to receive a raw csv of all the contributions my DAOs have made
2. See a report of the activeness of the DAO and be able to filter down to see the most active contributors

## Questions

- How does a DAO curate contributions attributed?
