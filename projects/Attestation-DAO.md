## The Problem

### Situation

The current process for managing DAO attestations is going to be heavy.

### Complications

If DAOs don't use the attestation system or actively attest towards their own contributors, the system starts to fall flat.

### Implication

We need to find ways to reduce the initial burden of managing attestations as Govrn builds a more seemless process and can pass along teachings to DAOs.

## Proposed Solution

Govrn can setup a "Verification DAO" which will go through users contribution and verify them as well as recommend whether the dao should give an attestation for that contribution.

A Govrn managed DAO can be the first phase. After a process is determined, we can build ways for similar DAOs to create their own horizontal verification DAOs that service the DAOs that use them.

### Features:

Reduces Duplicate Efforts:

- Many DAOs probably share similar set of contributions or have similar attestation standards and can trust the usage of the others attestations.
- DAOs will start to duplicate efforts of setting up attestation rings and systems.
