## Attestation Storage
- Will store an array of attestations on the NFT
- To make it more flexible can have the array point to a structure on ceramic

Would like it to be thought of as verification opposed to attestation
- Make the field flexible enough where it can plug any type of verification into the verify attribute
    - Start with simple straight attestations

Two levels of verification:
1. Attestation - The attestation itself
2. Verification Value (confidence interval/strength of attestation) - Are the attestations legitimate
3. Value of Contribution

The question to ask -> What's the minimum amount of data we need to produce and store for now?
- Level 2 and 3 are abstractions to what we need to build
- What we need is to store the attestations themselves, worry about they strength of attestations later. 
- Data to store so far:
    - Attestor Signatrue
    - Attestor Date
    - Confidence Interval

For v1 start with just the straight attestations and simple aggregations, afterwards we can work on more complex but stronger aggregations

**ðŸ“Œ Note:** As we want it to be more modular, we might want to do it as an extension/upgrade contracts.
- Downsides:
    - Security Vulnerabilities
    - Break third party integrations
