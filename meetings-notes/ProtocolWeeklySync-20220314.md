## Bot and Reporting
- Bot is done
- Reporting:
    - API is deployed
    - Reporting form is deployed as well
- Missing:
    - [ ] Hooking it all up
    - [ ] Setup DNS
    - [ ] Adding the free form field to the reporting form
    - [ ] Pulling in users created activity types
    - [ ] Need to migrate airtable data
    - [ ] Update the report URL in the bot
*Should be able to finish these two pieces tomorrow 3/15/2022*
-  Goal to do a cutover call Wednesday 3/16
-  Potential to use Flip from RG to work on the bot
    -  Has been doing work with RG bots, could already be well versed on this.
    -  Aaron to reach out to scott 

## Linear App

This is what we're going to use. Plan is to eventually sync with github but not a bit deal for now.


Items:

- [x] Can everyone access it?
- [x] Any questions


## Review Compensation Structure

Reviewed with team

Idea:
- [ ] Make the KR payment a sliding scale


## Review assumptions in Preliminary Tech Spec
- Reviewed Data Structure
    - Biggest questions from Aaron are:
        - Proof
        - Attestations
    - Guideline -> any conntribution can be minted without proof or attestatioons, up to the contributor to build them up over time.
- The doc has already outlined a lot of pieces.
    - Next steps is to prioritize from the existing list of features

Action Items:
- [ ] Create a v1 brainstorming session
    - [ ] Set up a lettucemeet to find time
