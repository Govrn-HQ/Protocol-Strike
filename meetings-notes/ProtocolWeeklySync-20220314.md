# Notes

---

Agenda:

1. Review Linear App
2. Update on new bot and reporting form process.
   1. Is create function ready?
   2. Readiness to go live? I think it's just dependent on the reporting form live?
3. Review Compensation Structure

## Linear App

This is what we're going to use. Plan is to eventually sync with github but not a bit deal for now.

Items:

- [ ] Can everyone access it?
- [ ] Any questions
